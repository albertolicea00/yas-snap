# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Development Setup


### Prerequisites

1. **Toolchain + Qt 6** — Debian/Ubuntu:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install build-essential cmake ninja-build \
        qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
        qml6-module-qtquick-controls qml6-module-qtquick-layouts
   ```
   Arch: `sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel cmake ninja qt6-base qt6-declarative`

The `snap` CLI itself must also be installed — the app is a GUI wrapper around it.

### Build environment

C++/Qt has no virtualenv; isolation comes from **out-of-source builds**: everything generated lives under `build/` (git-ignored) and the "environment" is pinned by `CMakePresets.json`. To reset the environment completely, run `make clean` and build again.

Day-to-day via the Makefile:

```bash
make build     # configure (if needed) + compile
make test      # build + run the QtTest suite
make run       # build + launch the app
make release   # optimized build
make help      # list all targets
```

Raw CMake equivalents, if you prefer: `cmake --preset default`, `cmake --build --preset default`, `ctest --preset default --output-on-failure`.

### Project structure

- `src/core/` — vendored YAS core (process runner, queue, models, controller). Kept identical across all YAS repos; if you fix a bug here, please mention it so the fix can be replicated suite-wide.
- `src/` — the snap adapter (command builders + output parsers) and `main.cpp`.
- `qml/core/` — shared design system and app shell (also vendored).
- `qml/` — app entry (`Main.qml`: brand accent + tag).
- `tests/` — QtTest unit tests; adapter parsers are tested against recorded CLI output.
